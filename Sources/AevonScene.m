//  Three of the calls this tweak needs carry more arguments than `perform` can
//  express (a block, an integer, a `BOOL` read without the ABI being guessed),
//  so the only honest way to reach them from Swift is objc_msgSend with an exact

//
//  Everything here is guarded: a selector that is not there returns nil (or -1,
//  or 0) instead of trapping. Callers log the answer and stop.
