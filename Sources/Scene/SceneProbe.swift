//
//  SceneProbe.swift — Aevon, the P0 probe for 窗口与场景.
//
//  Why look before building anything: the master's floating window is not a view
//  stuck into SpringBoard, it is its own UIScene built through
//  UIScenePresentationManager. Whether this iOS still exposes that surface, and
//  with exactly which signatures, cannot be guessed — a wrong type encoding is a
//  SpringBoard crash, and a wrong assumption about how the app's scene relates
//  to the carrier costs the whole phase. So this file only *looks*:
//
//    · which classes exist             NSClassFromString, nothing instantiated
//    · which selectors they answer     + the real method_getTypeEncoding
//    · what the live scene tree is     every scene, every window, right now
//    · whether a carrier-shaped view   _UIContextLayerHostView / *Presentation*
//      is already somewhere in it
//
//  Rules kept on purpose:
//    · never invoke an unknown selector — only responds(to:) is asked
//    · never create a scene, never touch a scene's settings
//    · one shot per request, so a respring cannot replay an old dump
//
//  Everything printed goes to /var/mobile/Aevon.log with a "scene: " prefix,
//  and every line is at least 16 bytes so it survives the strip (see
//  tools/push-gate.py: Swift encodes shorter literals as immediates).
